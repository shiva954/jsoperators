    <h3>
        Question 8:

        Write a program that accepts two numbers from the user. The program should:

        Perform a bitwise &, |, and ^ operation on the numbers and display the results.

        Shift the bits of the first number two places to the left and display the result.

        Compare the original and shifted number using comparison operators and log the results.


    </h3>

    <h3>open console for output</h3>
    <script>
        let a = Number(prompt("enter the first number:"));
        let b = Number(prompt("enter the second number:"));

        console.log(`the out put for a&b is ${a & b}`);
        console.log(`the output for a|b is ${a | b}`);
        console.log(`the output for a^b is ${a ^ b}`);

        let leftShift = a << 2;

        console.log(`the number before shift ${a} is ${leftShift} after the leftshift `);
