    <h3>
        Question 3:

        Build a program that takes a number from the user and:

        Performs both modulus and exponentiation on the number (e.g., number % 2, number ** 2) and displays the results.

        Use a comparison operator to check if the number is greater than 50, and log "Greater than 50" or "Less than or
        equal to 50."

        Use a ternary operator to check if the number is odd or even.


    </h3>

    <h3>open console for output</h3>
    <script>
        let a = Number(prompt("enter a number:"));
        console.log(`the modulus of the enter number is ${a % 2}`);
        console.log(`the exponentation of the enter number is ${a ** 2}`);
        a > 50 ? console.log(`the enter number is greater than 50`) : console.log(`the entered number less than or equal to  50 `);
        !(a & 1) ? console.log(`the enter number is even`) : console.log(`the entered number is odd`);

    </script>
