    <h3>
        Question 1:

        Write a program that asks the user for two numbers. Perform the following:

        Add, subtract, multiply, and divide the two numbers using arithmetic operators.

        Compare the two numbers using comparison operators (>, <,==) and log the result. Use an assignment operator (+=)
            to add 5 to the first number and log the updated value. </h3>

            <h3>open console for output</h3>
            <script>
                let a = Number(prompt("enter the first number:"));
                let b = Number(prompt("enter the second number: "));
                console.log(`the addition of ${a} and ${b} is : ${a + b}`);
                console.log(`the subtraction of ${a} and ${b} is : ${a - b}`);
                console.log(`the multiplication of ${a} and ${b} is : ${a * b}`);
                console.log(`the division of ${a} and ${b} is : ${a / b}`);
                console.log(`the modulus of ${a} and ${b} is : ${a % b}`);
                console.log(`the increment of ${a} is ${a + 1} and ${b} is ${b + 1}`);
                console.log(`the decrement of ${a} is ${a - 1} and ${b} is ${b - 1}`);
                console.log(`the comparison of a>b is : ${a > b}`);
                console.log(`the comparison of a<b is : ${a < b}`);
                console.log(`the comparison of a<=b is : ${a <= b}`);
                console.log(`the comparison of a>=b is : ${a >= b}`);
                console.log(`the comparison of a==b is : ${a == b}`);
                console.log(`the comparison of a===b is : ${a === b}`);
                console.log(`the comparison of a!=b is : ${a != b}`);
                console.log(`the comparison of a!==b is : ${a !== b}`);
                a += 5;
                console.log(`the updated value after the a+=5 is ${a}`);
