    <h3>
        Question 2:

        Create a program that accepts the user's first name, last name, and age as inputs. The program should:

        Concatenate the first and last name to display the full name.

        Use a ternary operator to check if the user is 18 or older and display a message indicating whether they are
        eligible to vote.

        Use a string operator to calculate the length of the full name and log whether the name is longer than 10
        characters.

    </h3>

    <h3>open console for output</h3>
    <script>
        let fn = prompt("enter your first name:");
        let ln = prompt("enter your last name:");
        let age = Number(prompt("enter your age:"));

        console.log(`your full name is ${fn} ${ln}`);
        age > 18 ? console.log(`ypu are eligible to vote`) : console.log(`you are not eligible to vote`);

        let fullname = fn + ln;

        fullname.length > 10 ? console.log(`the full name length is greater than 10`) : console.log(`the full name length is not greater than 10 `);

    </script>
