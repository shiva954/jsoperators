    <h3>
        Question 9:

        Create a program that evaluates a person’s eligibility for a loan. The program should:

        Ask for the person’s age, salary, and credit score.

        Use logical operators (&&, ||) to check if the person is eligible for a loan (e.g., age ≥ 21, salary > $30,000,
        or credit score > 650).

        Log whether the person is approved or denied based on these conditions.



    </h3>

    <h3>open console for output</h3>
    <script>
        let age = Number(prompt("enter your age :"));
        let salary = Number(prompt("enter your salary:"));
        let creditScore = Number(prompt("enter your credit score:"));

        (age >= 21) ? (salary >= 30000 && creditScore > 650) ? console.log(` you are eligible for loan`) : console.log(`you are not eligible for loan`) : console.log(`you are not eligible for loan`);
