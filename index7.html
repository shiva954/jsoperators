    <h3>
        Question 7:

        Create a program that accepts a sentence from the user and:

        Use string operators to reverse the sentence.

        Check if the reversed sentence is longer than 15 characters using a comparison operator.

        Use a logical operator (||) to log a message if either the original or reversed sentence has more than 20
        characters.


    </h3>

    <h3>open console for output</h3>
    <script>
        let string = prompt("enter the string to reverse:");
        let reverse = "";
        for (let i = string.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            reverse += string.charAt(i);
        }
        console.log(`the reverse string is ' ${reverse} '`);
        (reverse.length > 15) ? console.log(`the  reverse of the string length is greater than 15 `) : console.log(`the  reverse of the string length is  not greater than 15 `);
        (reverse.length > 20 || string.length > 20) ? console.log(`one of the string length is more than 20`) : console.log(`both the string lengths are less than 20 `);

    </script>
