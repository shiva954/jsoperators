    <h3>
        Question 5:

        Create a program where the user inputs two strings (e.g., a first name and a last name) and a number. The
        program should:

        Concatenate the strings and display the full name.

        Use the typeof operator to check if the number is of type number and display the result.

        Use assignment operators to increment the number by 10 and log the new value.



    </h3>

    <h3>open console for output</h3>
    <script>
        let fn = prompt("enter your first name:");
        let ln = prompt("enter your last name:");
        let n = prompt("enter a number :");

        console.log(`your full name is ${fn} ${ln}`);

        (typeof n == 'number') ? console.log(`the enter number is a type of number`) : console.log(`the entered number is not a type of number`);

        n += 10;
        console.log(`the value of n after the increment of 10 is ${n}`);
