    <h3>
        Question 4:

        Write a program that takes three numbers from the user. The program should:

        Add the first two numbers and display the result.

        Compare the sum of the first two numbers with the third number using comparison operators.

        Use a logical operator (&&) to check if the sum of the first two numbers is greater than 50 and the third number
        is less than 100, and log the result.

    </h3>

    <h3>open console for output</h3>
    <script>
        let a = Number(prompt("enter the first number :"));
        let b = Number(prompt("enter the second number :"));
        let c = Number(prompt("enter the third number :"));

        let sum = a + b;
        console.log(`the sum of first two number is ${sum}`);
        sum > c ? console.log(`the sum of first 2 number is greater than the third`) : console.log(`the sum of first 2 numbers is less than the third`);
        (sum > 50 && c < 100) ? console.log(`the sum of first 2 numbers is greater than 50 and the third number is less than 100`) : console.log(`the sum of first 2 numbers is either less than 50 or the third number is less than 100`);

    </script>
