    <h3>
        Question 6:

        Write a program that simulates a shopping cart:

        Ask the user to input the total amount.

        Use a ternary operator to apply a 15% discount if the total is over $150; otherwise, apply no discount.

        Use assignment operators to update the total amount after the discount and log the final price.


    </h3>

    <h3>open console for output</h3>
    <script>
      let total = Number(prompt("enter the total amount :"));
let eligble;
total >= 150 ? eligble = true : eligble = false;
total >= 150 ? console.log(`15 % discount applied`) : console.log(`the discount is not applied for total under 150$`);

let newprice = (15 / 100) * total;
eligble ? console.log(`the new total after discount is ${total - newprice}`) : eligble = false;


    </script>
